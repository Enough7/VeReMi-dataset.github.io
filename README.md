# VeReMi dataset

These pages describe the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) dataset, a dataset for the evaluation of misbehavior detection mechanisms for VANETs.
This dataset consists of message logs of on-board units, including a labelled ground truth, generated from a simulation environment.
The dataset includes malicious messages intended to trigger incorrect application behavior, which is what misbehavior detection mechanisms aim to prevent.
The initial dataset contains a number of simple attacks: the idea of this dataset release is not just to provide a baseline for the comparison of detection mechanisms, but also to serve as a starting point for more complex attacks.
VeReMi is part of a paper that is currently under review, submitted to the [SecureComm](http://securecomm.org/) conference.
More information will be published on these pages after the notification for that paper.

The dataset was primarily put together by [Rens van der Heijden](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/vs/inst/team/rens-van-der-heijden/) at the Institute of Distributed Systems, part of Ulm University. Please contact Rens if you have any questions, comments or criticism.
This work was supported in part by the [Baden-Württemberg Stiftung gGmbH Stuttgart](https://www.bwstiftung.de/) as part of the project IKT-05 [AutoDetect](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/vs/res/proj/autodetect/) of its IT security research programme. Simulations for this work were performed on the computational resource bwUniCluster funded by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Württemberg and the Universities of the State of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, within the framework program bwHPC.
