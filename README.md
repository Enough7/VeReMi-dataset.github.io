# VeReMi dataset

These pages describe the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) dataset, a dataset for the evaluation of misbehavior detection mechanisms for VANETs.
This dataset consists of message logs of on-board units, including a labelled ground truth, generated from a simulation environment.
The dataset includes malicious messages intended to trigger incorrect application behavior, which is what misbehavior detection mechanisms aim to prevent.
The initial dataset contains a number of simple attacks: the idea of this dataset release is not just to provide a baseline for the comparison of detection mechanisms, but also to serve as a starting point for more complex attacks.
VeReMi is part of a paper that is currently under review, submitted to the [SecureComm](http://securecomm.org/) conference.
More information will be published on these pages after the notification for that paper.
